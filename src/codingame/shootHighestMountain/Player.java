 * Rules
 * At the start of each game turn, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right.
 * By the end of the game turn, you must fire on the highest mountain by outputting its index (from 0 to 7).
 * Firing on a mountain will only destroy part of it, reducing its height. Your ship descends after each pass.
 *
 * The while loop represents the game.
 * Each iteration represents a turn of the game
 * where you are given inputs (the heights of the mountains)
 * and where you have to print an output (the index of the mountain to fire on)
 * The inputs you are given are automatically updated according to your last actions.
